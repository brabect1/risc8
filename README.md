# risc8
Derivative version of the free risc8 micro core originally by Tom Coonan.

As the original code was distributed under GPLv2 or later license, a choice
was made to license this derivate work under GPLv3.

The original code was once published on www.mindspring.com, which is no
longer available. A copy of the page along with the code archive and
documentation is still available under web archive (e.g.
<https://web.archive.org/web/20120118210705/http://www.mindspring.com/~tcoonan/newpic.html>).
